## What I learnt from this project

This project was initially an excuse to play around with the newer features of NgRx given that at work I work daily with an older version of this state management tech for Angular and we may consider upgrading soon.

The requirements of deploying this service publicly gave me an understanding of AWS, specifically Elastic Beanstalk, DNS setup, Domain management, Beanstalk deployment files and certificate configuration that I didn't have before.

# Tech stack

Frontend:

    Framework: Angular 8, upgrading to 9 recently

    JWT to handle token encryption and authentication
