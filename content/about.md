    Currently I am working at
    <a href="https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/">Johnson Controls</a>
    as <b>Software Engineer</b>. I am focusing on frontend
    development, implementing features working mainly with these 
    technologies: Angular 8, NgRx, RxJs, Scss, Node, GraphQl. The
    projects I am working on have a  microservice architecture.
    Occasionally I work on these backend microservices using Java
    and Spring Boot.  I work closely with back-end engineers to plan
    and/or adapt client-service contracts and address any 
    challenges that may arise.

    integrations with Magento. It involved  full stack development
    so I was expected to have a deep technical expertise across the
